      <description><![CDATA[Susan Beal puts a fresh spin on the very traditional craft of log cabin quilting. Each week, you&rsquo;ll explore a different block style, from easy, graphic square-within-a-square blocks to minimalist, modern crosses and even improvised quartered wonky blocks. The course is perfectly suited to both seasoned quilters and newbies, with ample hand-holding on core techniques, expert tips on block settings, and lessons on how to play with color and print to make your designs pop. At the end of each class, Susan shares a fabulous project to make with what you learned, including baby quilts, bags, pillows and table runners.]]></description>
