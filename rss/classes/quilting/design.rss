      <description><![CDATA[Anna Maria Horner is a master with color. In this class, she shows you how to switch up traditional color conventions in order to develop your own stunning palettes. Beginning with a traditional color wheel, Anna demonstrates how each color interacts with one another depending on its position in the wheel. Then, using paint chips, she walks you through a color swap exercise where you will learn how to mix and match hues. Anna explains how to apply this information to printed fabrics, demonstrating how scale and proportion can be used to create new and interesting patchwork combinations. This class is ideal for anyone who wants to understand how to work intuitively with color and print.]]></description>

While it’s typically important to cut precisely and match your points perfectly, modern quilter Heather Jones teaches a method for piecing this block without measuring or matching, resulting in a loose, contemporary version of the original. This class is a fun way to create blocks quickly using leftover scraps of fabric, and it’s perfect for anyone who wants to practice improvisational quilting techniques and play with color.]]></description>

In this workshop, Liza deconstructs quilt construction and its vernacular – explaining patches, blocks, batting, sashing, binding, borders, quilting and more. This is a beautiful show and tell of different quilt traditions and techniques – from antique log cabin and crazy quilts to applique, string piecing and paper piecing quilts. Throughout, Liza emphasizes the “make-do” tradition of quilting with a warmth and reverence that inspires.
