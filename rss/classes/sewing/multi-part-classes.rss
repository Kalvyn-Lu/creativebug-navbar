      <description><![CDATA[In this three-part master course, professional bag designer Nicole Mallalieu expertly guides you through the bag design process from concept to construction. Learn how to break three-dimensional bag shapes down into two-dimensional shapes, play with construction lines and seam allowances, and then figure out how your bag design will fit together. Sound hard? It&rsquo;s not as scary as you might think! And since we&rsquo;re mocking everything up in muslin, the pressure is off until you get your bag design just right.<br />

These patterns are classic &ndash; yet with different fabric choices, you can bring your own sense of style, from traditional to edgy. At the end of this class, you will not only have made three perfectly finished garments, but you will also have learned skills that will empower you to sew any garment with confidence.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[If you have ever dreamed of sewing a wardrobe for yourself but don&rsquo;t feel confident reading sewing patterns, this class is just for you. Deborah Kreiling has been creating sewing patterns with the Simplicity Pattern Company for 35 years, and in this four-part course, she will teach you all of the basic skills you need to know to follow a pattern and make gorgeous clothing. Focusing on two patterns &ndash; a classic gathered skirt, and a sleek Cynthia Rowley top and dress &ndash; Deborah will be with you every step of the way, from deciphering the pattern envelope and picking your size and fabric, to cutting and piecing basics, plus special techniques like inserting pockets, adding gathers, inserting invisible zippers, and adding facings. These patterns are classic &ndash; yet with different fabric choices, you can bring your own sense of style, from traditional to edgy. At the end of this class, you will not only have made three perfectly finished garments, but you will also have learned skills that will empower you to sew any garment with confidence.]]></description>
