      <description><![CDATA[Jumpstart your artistic practice with six weeks of creativity exercises taught by Lisa Congdon. Using a variety of Lisa&#39;s favorite art supplies and tried-and-true processes, learn how to use Microns, oil sticks, paints and collage to take a fresh look at shape, line and color. These exercises allow you to &quot;get loose&quot; and enjoy the process without overthinking the outcome. You&rsquo;ll also learn how to work with color, use collage to respond to your in-progress artwork, and go outside to gather inspiration from your surroundings. Unlike Lisa&#39;s other classes, this series focuses less on specific projects and dives deeply into the artistic process to help you develop your own creative voice.<br />

In this three-part course, you will begin by learning how to draw everyday objects with pencil and paper, and then throughout the course you&rsquo;ll learn how to render and add color to more complex shapes. By the end of the course, you&rsquo;ll be drawing multi-faceted illustrations and learning how to think (and create) like an illustrator.]]></description>
