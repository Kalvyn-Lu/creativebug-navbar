      <description><![CDATA[Worked up in gorgeous linen yarn, this lightweight pullover is perfect for spring and transitional weather. The unusual construction of the sweater is part of what makes it so fun to knit &ndash; the front and back are both started at the center and worked outward in rows of easy lace. The front and back are then joined seamlessly, and the sleeves and body stitches are worked in the round down to the hem.

      <description><![CDATA[Wendy shows knitters a quick and easy way to whip up a personalized sweater for your dog using two knitted rectangles. Using nothing more than your dog&rsquo;s measurements and a gauge swatch, you&rsquo;ll do a little math and then start casting on. This class is a perfect stash-buster &mdash; simply use yarns in a similar gauge to make a fun, striped motif. The sweater can be customized for any size dog by adjusting the number of cast on stitches and the quantity of yarn.

      <description><![CDATA[In this class, Gudrun walks you through every step of making a cute, vintage-style cardigan. This seamless sweater is worked in one piece from the top down, so there are no tails to weave in at the end. All of the shaping is done with decreases, increases, and short rows, and simple lacework adorns the shoulders, giving it just a touch of sweetness. Gudrun demonstrates lots of tips and tricks along the way, including lessons on how to properly pick up stitches as well as a thorough tutorial on working in the round using the &quot;Magic Loop&rdquo; method. When the body of the sweater is finished, Gudrun will show you how to add button bands and create a Peter Pan collar, both of which are finished with an I-cord bind-off. Use this class in conjunction with the written pattern to ensure that you get the perfect fit with a polished finish.]]></description>
