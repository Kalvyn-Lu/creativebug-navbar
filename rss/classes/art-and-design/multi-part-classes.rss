      <description><![CDATA[Jumpstart your artistic practice with six weeks of creativity exercises taught by Lisa Congdon. Using a variety of Lisa&#39;s favorite art supplies and tried-and-true processes, learn how to use Microns, oil sticks, paints and collage to take a fresh look at shape, line and color. These exercises allow you to &quot;get loose&quot; and enjoy the process without overthinking the outcome. You&rsquo;ll also learn how to work with color, use collage to respond to your in-progress artwork, and go outside to gather inspiration from your surroundings. Unlike Lisa&#39;s other classes, this series focuses less on specific projects and dives deeply into the artistic process to help you develop your own creative voice.<br />

      <description><![CDATA[The team at Creativebug is surrounded by inspiration every day, but even the most prolific amongst us needs a jumpstart now and then. We asked members of our staff to share their go-to tips for finding creativity when the well has run dry. Their answers are as versatile as the artists themselves. Each day this month, members of our staff will be sharing their favorite ways to stoke the creative fires. Join us for a month of painting, drawing, journaling, organizing, upcycling, beautifying, and so much more.<br />

      <description><![CDATA[For this month-long daily drawing challenge, we&rsquo;ve added a twist. Artist and educator Lisa Solomon shows how to use overhead light and everyday objects to cast interesting shadows onto paper, then draw around the shadows to create outlines. What you do within the outlines is where the real fun begins. Each day, Lisa shares a new idea filling outlined shapes with color and texture, using everything from pens and graphite to watercolors and highlighters. This technique is a great way to experiment with composition and keep your drawing practice loose. Simply start with a shadow and allow yourself to play within the lines.&nbsp;<br />
