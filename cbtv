        <div class="playbut" data-video="instructor/fancy-tiger" data-title="Fancy Tiger " data-description="Jaime Jennings and Amber Corcoran own Fancy Tiger Crafts - a revolutionary shop based in Denver CO that specializes in craft supplies and classes for the modern crafter. Fancy Tiger Crafts&#39; vision is to inspire people to reach their crafting potential through modern and sustainable supplies and quality instruction in fiber and textile-related crafts. Amber and Jaime believe that making things by hand makes people feel better and that if more people made things, the world would be a better place.

Jaime&#39;s love of crafting had early beginnings spending lots of time in her mom&#39;s shop, The Craft Peddler in Parker, Colorado. She learned to knit in 2001 and it&#39;s been non-stop fiber action ever since.

Amber has a background in photography, painting and graphic design, but has always loved making things by hand. Once she discovered knitting and sewing she was absolutely hooked. She loves the creative process of making something by hand that is meant to be used and loved.&nbsp;

Jaime and Amber met in Galveston, Texas in the early 2000&#39;s and became fast friends. Jaime started Fancy Tiger in 2006 and then invited Amber to partner with her in 2008 - its been a perfect match ever since. In addition to the retail shop in Denver and the online shop, they also produce and design crafting kits, sewing and knitting patterns and even have their own yarn line. Jaime and Amber both love to make everything--from clothes and quilts to sweaters and shawls. They are avid hand-spinners and expert needlefelters. They wear handmade items every day. In her spare time, Jaime loves hiking, traveling and seeking out delicious lattes.&nbsp;Amber likes foraging for mushrooms, savoring scotch and making things up as she goes.">

Through her signature process of etching in clay, the shadows of birds and rabbits come alive to play in forests of intricately rendered botanical specimens, exotic sea creatures lurk below antique sailing vessels, primitive marking allude to atomic structures and everyday objects blur the lines between form and function.
Fayt’s work can be found in myriad of public and private art collections both in the United States and abroad. She has been featured on the cover of Ceramics Monthly as well as in numerous Japanese and American Publications, such as Zakka, Lee, Mademoiselle  (Japan) and Sunset Magazine, San Francisco 7x7, and 'Crafting a Meaningful Home' (STC craft publications). Her roster of clients include Heath Ceramics and Terrain.
When she is not working in her Bayview studio, she can be found teaching technique in workshops around the country at destinations such as Santa Fe Clay and Metchosin School of the Arts, online, at Creativebug.com and via her self-created online e-course, The Clayer.  A graduate of the California College of the Arts  (formerly California College of Arts and Crafts), she currently lives and works in Nevada City, CA, with a sweet pooch named Louie and an ever growing collection of fine art and found ephemera.">

According to author/ designer and Mably mentor Kaffe Fassett, Mably has 'one of the sharpest eyes for style' that he has ever come across.
With no formal education in design, Mably made a radical career change from cooking to knitting in the late 1980's after a chance meeting with the world-famous Fassett. From the moment he entered Fassett's studio, Mably realised the creative potential of knitwear designs and soon became Fassett's apprentice. For many years Mably organized the running of the Fassett studio, where Fassett trained him to knit, needlepoint, hook rag rugs, and grout mosaics. An inspiring teacher, Mably began travelling the world with Fassett doing workshops. Exotic locales such as Africa, Iceland, Guatemala, and India filled his designer's eye with inspiration and an explosion of colour and pattern.
An avid and enthusiastic teacher, Mably has learned one thing over the years - that most people have buried in them a sense of colour and design. And it is helping his students discover that design sensibility that continues to inspire and motivate Mably's work.Mably's current workshop is entitled 'Concentrating on Colour in Design' and focuses on knitting, needlepoint, and patchwork. Since taking over the teaching of knit workshops from Fassett altogether, he has taught throughout the United States, Canada, Japan, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, France, Germany, and the UK.">

While staying at home with her baby, Wendy began knitting and blogging about her adventures at Knit and Tonic, a blog that she started in 2005 out of boredom and a desire to keep her thirst for writing alive. &ldquo;While I blogged about adjusting existing knitting patterns, and showing off my results, readers kept asking me if I would begin designing and sharing my results,&rdquo; Wendy says. &ldquo;I read up on different techniques, threw myself into the whole thing, and next thing I knew, a literary agent contacted me and asked me if I wanted to write a book about knitting.&rdquo;

In 2008, her first book, &ldquo;Custom Knits&rdquo; was published by Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, a division of Harry N. Abrams. Since then, she has written three more books, &ldquo;Custom Knits 2,&rdquo; &ldquo;Custom Knits Accessories, and &ldquo;Up, Down, All-Around Stitch Dictionary,&rdquo; which is the first stitch dictionary of its kind, one that shows knitters how to re-create stitch patterns not only flat, but in the round and top down, which she says helps knitters to free up the critical part of their minds and have even more fun knitting.

Wendy lives in Southern California with her husband and daughter. Her favorite thing to do is hang out with them on the weekends and go to the beach to knit.">

Started by best friends Alethea Harampolis and Jill Rizzo, Studio Choo focuses on locally sourced plants and flowers, styled with a nod to the wild and untamed.

Each woman&#39;s love of the natural world began when they were small. Alethea&#39;s childhood was spent in her mother&#39;s garden in Marin; committing each flower, tree and plants name to memory. She later became an estate gardener in Seattle, where she managed the pastoral rolling hills of the city&#39;s rich and famous. Jill grew up in the flower shops run by her mother, aunt, and uncle in Rhode Island - devoting her time after school to making posies out of the day&#39;s cast-offs. She struck out on her own to become an artist, graduating with a degree in illustration from Parsons School of Design, before moving to California to try life out west.

Alethea and Jill met and worked together at an esteemed flower shop in San Francisco. Their shared passion and dedication to local, sustainable and wild where possible led them to found Studio Choo in 2009. For the first year, the business ran out of Jill&#39;s kitchen, Alethea&#39;s Honda Element, and a family-member&#39;s garage.

In January 2010, Studio Choo joined forces with Magpie &amp; Rye to form Prairie Collective. They opened a small shop off Divisadero featuring fresh flowers, jewelry, home accessories and souvenirs of the past. After many weddings, deliveries and penning their first book, &quot;The Flower Recipe Book,&quot; Studio Choo was ready to expand into a new studio space in South San Francisco in March 2013.

&quot;The Flower Recipe Book&quot; took them across the nation, teaching design classes in massive markets, quaint shops and beautiful farms. When they returned home, they worked tirelessly to turn their studio into a unique expanse devoted to workshops, an apothecary, a workspace for weddings and events, a well-curated shop and a place to honor the love of flowers that started it all. &nbsp;">

Megumi represents a unique gift wrapping style, guided by her Japanese heritage and a culture that places value in the thought behind a gift symbolized through presentation and wrapping. She brings to the forefront the traditional origins of gift wrapping where packaging was artful and resourceful and achieved by using materials already on hand. Bringing this sensibility to the modern day, Megumi often uses repurposed, found, organic and recycled materials because they represent her belief in the potential of beauty and a second life for the things we carelessly throw away. She shares her passion, ideas and techniques for gift wrapping through workshops, demonstrations, hosting events for both charity and businesses and volunteers at her childrens schools.  Megumi was named runner-up in Scotch Brand’s national contest for America’s Most Gifted Wrapper. She has appeared on television including the Ellen De Generes Show and local San Francisco stations, as well as being featured in the San Francisco Chronicle.

        <div class="playbut" data-video="instructor/lynne-barr" data-title="Lynne Barr" data-description="Lynne Barr is a knitwear designer and author who brings an enthusiasm for innovation and modern design to her books and workshops. She understands and respects the value of historical lessons and the foundation they offer, but it&rsquo;s the unknown territory of never-before-seen techniques that compels her. She finds that leaping into a design, rather than taking incremental steps, often leads to a more interesting creation.

Her book Knitting New Scarves (STC Craft, 2007) used groundbreaking techniques to create many new three-dimensional hand knit shapes. Two books that followed, Reversible Knitting (STC Craft, 2009) and The Shape of Knitting (STC Craft 2013) also include new techniques for knitters to add to their technical repertoire. What Lynne most hopes is that other knitters will find her work an inspirational platform from which to make their own creative leaps.

Lynne lives in the White Mountain foothills of Maine with her husband Doug, where they raised and home schooled their children in their self-designed home. They love working together, designing, inventing, and creating.

Her mother and grandmother sewed and knitted. Her family owned a small town department store and the 'remnant' department was her favorite corner of the store with the brilliant squares of craft felt, magical drawers filled with embroidery thread and bolts of cotton fabrics.
Her quiltmaking began at college where she sewed 25 bandanas together to make a quilt for her boyfriend's water bed.  After college she went to graduate school to become a clinical psychologist and worked evenings and weekends at a high end needlepoint shop. She soon dropped out of school, to work full time at the shop.  Following that she opened her own store and many years later,when it closed, she became a knitting yarn sales rep. One of the companies she represented was the brand new Rowan Yarn Company whose lead designer was Kaffe Fassett.
Kaffe and Liza became good friends and when she took up quiltmaking again, she convinced him to work with her to do a book. That was 1993 and since then the two of them have written 5 hardcover books and collaborated with others on 15 soft cover books. They convinced other friends to start the Rowan Patchwork and Quilting Company and it has grown beyond their expectations.
Kaffe and Liza consider themselves traditional quiltmakers but with a contemporary sense of color and design.

Her stitched drawings on fabric explore issues of identity through thinly veiled metaphors utilizing old fashioned imagery and double entendres. She learned how to embroider in college in a feminist art history class, and has been inspired by the history of American needlework ever since. Approaching the technique of embroidery as a way of drawing, Ringquist has taught hundreds of people new ways of making marks on fabric through classes and workshops around the country. Her design company, Dropcloth, sells Ringquist’s hand drawn designs that are printed as embroidery patterns, all ready to hoop and sew. In 2005, Rebecca was awarded an Illinois Arts Council Fellowship. Her work has since been exhibited at the Hyde Park Art Center, The California Polytechnic University, ARC Gallery, Fraction Workspace, Northern Illinois University, The Textile Art Center in Brooklyn, Packer Schopf Gallery, Pop tArt Gallery, and the Museum of Art and Design in NYC. Ringquist earned her MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in the Fiber and Material Studies department where she subsequently taught for seven years before moving to Brooklyn in 2011. She teaches, lectures and exhibits nationally.
Her first book, Rebecca Ringquist's Embroidery Workshops, A Bend the Rules Primer, published by STC Craft/Melanie Falick Books is available now wherever books are sold.

Andersen has been crafting, baking, cooking, drawing, sculpting and gardening since she could hold a crayon. As a former member of corporate-America, she swapped her suit jacket for a non-stick smock in 2010 and hasn't looked back. She's an experienced marketing professional, craft show vendor, seasoned event coordinator, photography instructor,  Funny or Die prop-maker, and freelance writer who approaches every new craft with the same mantra, “how hard could it be?” Megan's goal for the blog, 'In Words and Pictures'  is to provide crafts, recipes and inspiration to make every day a little more rad. 

She currently lives in Los Angeles with her loving husband and 500+ carnivorous plants she's raised by hand- but she dreams of someday owing a farm in the country with a craft studio, 2-story garage (for the Mr.) and ducks running wild in the garden.">

While she has been painting and drawing since the age of five, her introduction to watercolor began years ago while trying to explore new mediums and techniques. She fell in love with using watercolor almost immediately and it has since become her signature painting medium. Watercolor provided a visual voice for her creative ideas and inspired her to take the leap and start her own design studio in 2012.

Founded in Columbus, Ohio, Yao Cheng Design is a design studio and online shop where Yao creates bright and beautiful art prints, textiles, and paper goods for the home. In this digital age, the beauty of hand-painted designs is often lost. We forget that every brush stroke is individual, and that there is intention and a story behind every mark. Yao&rsquo;s watercolor designs embrace these subtle&nbsp;imperfections -- it&#39;s what makes her work truly personal and special!&nbsp;


She is best know for her simple, bright and expressive watercolor style. Her designs and products can be found in stores like West Elm, Minted, One Kings Lane and her own online shop. Her work has also been featured in magazines and blogs such as Southern Living, Mollie Makes, Style Me Pretty, and Design Love Fest,among others.">
