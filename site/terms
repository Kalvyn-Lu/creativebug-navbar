    <p class="revision-stamp">
      Creativebug, LLC
      <br>
      www.creativebug.com
      <br>
      Website Terms of Use
      <br>
      Revised as of February 10, 2015
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Welcome to the www.creativebug.com network of websites and Applications (the “Site”) of Creativebug LLC, a California limited liability corporation (“Creativebug,” also referred to herein as “us,” “we” and “our”). Thank you for your interest in using our services (“Services”) and tangible products (separately, “Products,” and collectively “Offerings”). As part of our Offerings, we provide our Registered Users (defined below) access to our Site, and to a wide array of arts and crafts related multi-media content, including video classes, audio, graphics, photos, text, special features, digital downloads and/or messages, and a forum for blogs and postings (collectively, “Content”) from experienced artist instructors (“Artists”), students and others. We provide access to the Content by streaming it over the internet.</p>

    <h2>Binding Agreement</h2>

    <p>These Terms of Use (including any linked policies, such as but not limited to our <a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#pp" href="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and our Community Guidelines), as they or any of them may be updated from time to time (collectively, this “Agreement”), constitute a binding contract between you and us if you apply to subscribe to our Services under this Agreement without limitation or qualification, and we agree to provide them. References to “you” in these Terms of Use refer to the individuals who either: (i) join the Site with a free membership to access free Services and contribute Content to the Site (ii) subscribe to the Services and meet the requirements of Subscribers set forth below (“Subscribers”), or (iii) Artists and others who contribute Content to the Site (collectively with Subscribers, “Registered Users”).</p>

    <p>These Terms of Use explain our, your, and other Registered Users’ respective rights and limitations governing the Site, Offerings, and Content. This includes explaining how our Services work, including the kinds of data we collect, the way we bill, how we interact with you, restrictions on your access to and use of the Site, limitations of our liability, warranty disclaimers, indemnities, and other important terms. We encourage you to revisit these Terms of Use and the rest of this Agreement whenever you have a question and from time to time, as they may be updated or amended frequently at Creativebug’s discretion.</p>

    <p>PLEASE THEREFORE CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT BEFORE YOU REGISTER OR USE ANY SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS AGREEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY, YOU MAY NOT REGISTER OR USE ANY SERVICES, AND DOING SO WOULD BE UNAUTHORIZED, CONSTITUTE A TRESPASS, AND VIOLATE APPLICABLE LAW. Any acceptance of your offer, and the provision of our Offerings will occur at our principal places of business, currently in San Francisco, California.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change this Agreement at any time, effective ten (10) days after posting of the revised Agreement on the Site. Your continued use of the Site or any Services after such posting or notification means you accept all revisions. If you do not agree to the revised Agreement, you must terminate this Agreement pursuant to the termination provisions below, and discontinue your use of this Site and all Services. Except solely as provided in this paragraph and the severability provision of this Agreement, this Agreement may not be changed without the handwritten (non-electronic) signature of an authorized person at Creativebug&reg;.</p>

Your Profile must, at a minimum, include a username of your choice and a profile picture (which may be a photograph or image provided by you or a default option provided by Creativebug). You may also, at your election, display on your Profile other information which you wish to make public such as a profile description prepared by you, links to your website, blog, Twitter feed, Facebook page or other online presence, interests (e.g., knitting, jewelry, painting), including content created by you and submitted to Creativebug in connection with your use of the Site and your participation in classes (including video and/or written content, images, information and other materials (collectively, “User Submissions”). You understand that whether or not such User Submissions are published, Creativebug does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any User Submissions. (We discuss User Submissions more fully under the heading, User Submissions, below.)</p>

    <p>You must promptly notify us if any of your registration information changes. If you fail to provide or update such information, we may suspend or terminate your subscription or registration, and we may not be able to contact you to provide information in which you may be interested.

If you do not agree to (or cannot comply with) all of the terms of this Agreement, do not agree to the Terms of Use or use the Site or any Services.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to deny you and others access to the Site, refuse service, suspend or terminate accounts, remove or edit Content, or cancel orders at any time, either temporarily or permanently, for any reason in our sole discretion, including without limitation our determination that you have failed to abide by the terms of this Agreement or appear likely to us to do so. By granting you access at any time, we do not obligate ourselves to maintain the Site in any form, and we expressly reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate your access privileges. You agree and understand that we may, in our sole discretion and without any prior notice, close the Site and delete any files which you may maintain at the Site and any information which you may choose to post. You should keep a copy of any material which you post to or maintain at the Site because we will not undertake to retain copies of any material which we or others may delete from the Site.</p>

    <p>The Creativebug Application allows you to access certain materials and functionality available on the Site through a tablet or mobile device. Creativebug reserves the right to withdraw or amend any Application at any time for any reason. As a Registered User, You acknowledge that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will continue to apply when using an Application. You acknowledge you may be charged by your mobile network provider for access to mobile network connection services while accessing an Application or any such third party charges as may arise, and you accept responsibility for any such charges that arise. If you are not responsible for the bill payment of the service for the mobile telephone or handheld device being used to access an Application, you will also be assumed to have received permission to access the Application from the responsible party.</p>

    <p>To use an Application, you will be required to have a compatible mobile telephone or handheld device, internet access, and certain minimum specifications that are specified within the Application. Creativebug does not accept any responsibility for the unavailability of any Application, or any difficulty or inability to download or access content or any other communication system failure that may result in an Application being unavailable. Creativebug will not be responsible for any support or maintenance for Applications.</p>

    <h2>Electronic Communications</h2>

    <p>When you visit our Site or email us, you are communicating with us electronically. You consent to receive communications from us electronically, either by email or notices we post on our Site, and if necessary, by regular mail or telephone. You agree that any agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfies any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p>

    <h2>Licenses</h2>

    <p>As between the parties, and provided that you continue to meet all of the Registered User requirements, we grant to you as a limited, non-exclusive, personal, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, revocable, license to access and use the Site and Services only in order to view only such Content on no more than one (1) computer or personal device at the same time and, for Subscribers, solely for your non-commercial, personal or household use (“License”). Except for the foregoing limited License, no right, title or interest is provided to you. If you are a Subscriber, your License extends only during your subscription period. If you are an Artist, these Terms of Service incorporate by reference the separate Artist Agreement between you and us, and your License term extends only during the period specified therein. By posting or providing to us any Content on the Site, you grant to us a non-exclusive, perpetual, paid-up, royalty-free worldwide, license to use (including but not limited to copying, sublicensing, creating derivative works of, and performing publicly) your Content on the Site and in any other media.</p>

    <p>The License will enable you to view, select, stream and access Content via the Services in accordance with these Terms of Use during the term of your subscription. Not all Content may be available for all purposes or at all times. Access to certain Content may depend, among other things, upon your geographic location (i.e. you will not be permitted to access Content from outside the Territory), whether you are able to maintain an internet connection, and available bandwidth and equipment used to access the Services. While we do our best to keep the Content descriptions up-to-date, we do not warrant that such descriptions will always be complete, current, or accurate. No transfer of ownership to any portion of the Content shall be made as a result of any access you are granted to the Site or Services. Any unauthorized copying, retransmission, display, performance, or distribution of the Site, Content or any portion thereof, and any material breach or violation of these Terms of Use, automatically terminates the license granted to you, obligates you to cease all use of the Service, and may constitute copyright infringement. Creativebug and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service and the Content.</p>

    <h2>Restrictions</h2>

    <p>Except as provided in the License and except for your own Content that you authored and uploaded to the Site, you may not download or copy (other than through page caching necessary for personal use, or as otherwise expressly permitted by these Terms of Use), or distribute, transmit, display, perform publicly, publish, upload, edit, post, link to, frame, transmit, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, modify, create derivative works of, or offer for sale, in whole or in part, any Content, advertisements, or other information contained on, or obtained from or through, the Site without our express written consent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you may not distribute any part of these Services over any network, including a local area network, nor sell or offer it or them for sale.</p>

    <p>You may not use any data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools on the Site or on any portion of it. You may not circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade or thwart any of the content protections in the Site or any copyright or trademark notices on any Content. Any unauthorized use of the Site, any Services or any Content or any other content (e.g., promotional materials) will automatically and without notice terminate the limited License granted by us and will result in the cancellation of your subscription. You may not decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce the code used in any software or digital rights management feature on the Site into a readable form in order to examine the construction of such software and/or to copy or create other competitive products or materials based in whole or in part on such software or any feature of the Site or Services or Content, or intercepting or recording network communications between the Site and us.</p>

    <p>In no event shall any Content, Artist Submissions or User Submissions be used for any website or publication of any sort which is competitive with the Site. For the sake of clarity, a website or publication is competitive if it distributes, publishes or otherwise makes available by any means educational courses and materials in any field or if it is otherwise competitive with any business activities of Creativebug and/or the Site.</p>

    <p>We and our affiliates and partners may suspend or terminate your subscription and access to the Site immediately if we reasonably determine that you or anyone for whom you are responsible hereunder are in violation of the Terms of Use or receive information that you no longer meet the Subscriber requirements. In such event, you must cease all use of the Services. The suspension or termination of your subscription is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights and remedies available to us and our partners and affiliates under the Terms of Use or under applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>Service Updates and Software</h2>

    <p>At various times, we may choose to make available updates, bug fixes, enhancements or other changes to the Services or Site (collectively, “Service Updates”). Service Updates may be: (i) automatic, such as in connection with general network changes and additional features or updates to data required by the Service; (ii) at your election, in which instance you will receive information and instructions for how to authorize optional Service Updates; or (iii) mandatory, in which case you will be required to consent to the Service Update or install or upgrade a third-party plug-in if you wish to maintain continued access to the Site and fully utilize the Services.</p>

    <h2>Payment for Offerings</h2>

    <h3>Subscription Plans and Fees, Class Credits, and Refund Policy</h3>

    <p><strong>Subscription Plans.</strong> Creativebug offers a monthly recurring subscription, multi-month non-renewing subscriptions and gift subscriptions for differing subscription periods, currently monthly, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month periods. As an active subscriber, a user receives full access to all classes on Creativebug.com. We also may, but are not promising to, offer trial periods, special promotional plans, bundled plans, premium services with respect to one or more types or categories of Content, and subscriptions with different limitations.</p>

    <p>WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, TERMINATE OR OTHERWISE AMEND OUR OFFERED SUBSCRIPTION PLANS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.</p>

    <p>Recipients of gift subscriptions will receive a welcome email from us notifying them of your gift. Such recipients must register with us to become a Subscriber. To view the specific details of your subscription, visit the Site and click on the Account Profile icon to view your Membership Plan information. You can cancel your subscription from creativebug.com by logging in and choosing Account Profile icon from the top right side of the site, then selecting Cancel Subscription under the Account menu These Terms of Use shall survive any cancellation or termination of your subscription.</p>

    <p><strong>Class Credits - Monthly Subscribers.</strong> Class Credits are an added subscriber benefit which can be redeemed to add classes to a user’s Library. Each credit allows the addition of a single class to the Library. Access to classes within a user’s Library does not expire, and users will continue to have access to the classes in their Library even after they are no longer active subscribers.</p>

    <p>Subscribers with active subscriptions will receive one Class Credit at the time of the initial subscription purchase, and one additional Class Credit with each monthly renewal charge.  Subscribers in a free trail period will not earn a Class Credit until the free trial has ended and an initial payment of a paid subscription has been made. Class Credits received but not yet redeemed will be displayed in a user’s profile next to the My Classes tab.</p>

    <p>A user must have an active subscription to redeem Class Credits. If a user’s subscription has expired and the user has Class Credits remaining, the user must reactive their subscription within six months in order to redeem Class Credits. With the reactivation of a subscription, the user will also receive one additional Class Credit that can be redeemed at any time through the duration of a paid subscription.</p>

    <p>Class Credits may be redeemed through the creativebug.com website or mobile website. Class Credits cannot be redeemed through mobile applications. Once a Class has been added to the Library, that class may not be exchanged for a different class. Once a Class has been added to the Library it may not be credited for a future Class credit.</p>

    <p>WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, TERMINATE OR OTHERWISE AMEND THE OFFERING OF CLASS CREDITS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.</p>

    <p><strong>Class Credits – Gift Subscriptions.</strong>  Recipients of multi-month non-renewing subscriptions and gift subscriptions will receive all eligible Class Credits when the non-renewing subscription or gift subscription is added to an active subscription account. For example, when a three (3) month subscription is added to an account, the subscriber will receive three (3) Class Credits. No additional Class Credits will be given for the duration of the non-renewing subscription or gift subscription.</p>

    <p><strong>Payment.</strong> By starting your Creativebug subscription, you expressly agree that we are authorized when you register to charge to the Payment Method you provided at that time (or to a different Payment Method if you change your Billing information or we change Payment Methods) the applicable subscription fee at the then current rate plus any applicable taxes, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Services or purchase of Products. We will begin billing your Payment Method for such amounts at the end of the free trial period of your subscription unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period, beginning of your subscription AND, EXCEPT FOR NON-RENEWING SUBSCRIPTIONS AND GIFT SUBSCRIPTIONS, AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SUBSEQUENT CORRESPONDING SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD THEREAFTER UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO SUCH RENEWAL. Discounts, rebates or other special offers are only valid for the initial subscription period; subscriptions therefore renew at the then-current full subscription rate. If an existing Subscriber receives a non-renewing subscription or gift subscription, Creativebug will either (i) credit the value of the non-renewing subscription or gift subscription towards the Subscriber’s renewal subscription payment obligations if the non-renewing subscription or gift subscription period is shorter than the Subscriber’s existing subscription, or (ii) commence the non-renewing subscription or gift subscription after the termination of the person’s existing subscription if the non-renewing subscription or gift subscription period is longer than the Subscriber’s existing subscription.</p>

    <p>Subscription fees and charges for both standard and non-renewing subscriptions or gift subscriptions are fully earned upon payment. UNUSED SUBSCRIPTION FEES ARE THEREFORE NON-REFUNDABLE. Gift subscriptions have no exchange, cash or surrender value. Each Subscriber’s License is expressly conditioned upon timely payment of all applicable subscription fees.</p>

    <p>At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, bonus, or other consideration to some or all of our Subscribers (“considerations”). The amount and form of such considerations, and the decision to provide them or not, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of considerations in one instance does not entitle you to considerations in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide considerations in the future, under any circumstance.</p>

    <p>Additional charges for Services may include, without limitation, gift subscription purchases you make, or changes in subscription plans. We may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you at least thirty (30) days’ advance notice of these changes by email. Such notices to you shall be deemed to have been given upon transmission.</p>

    <h3>Video Class Sales</h3>

    <p>Registered Users who comply with the Terms of Use may buy video classes either separately or (when available) bundled through the Site.  To order a video class, you will need to follow the ordering procedures on the Site.  Pricing details for video classes and the procedures for payment and delivery are displayed on the Site.  Prices are subject to change without notice.  You must pay for the video class(es) purchased from the Site by credit card, through Paypal, or by other methods specified on the Site.</p>

    <p>You represent and warrant that all details you provide to us for the purpose of purchasing video classes from the Site will be correct, that the credit card, or any alectronic cash, which you use is your own and that there are sufficient funds or credit facilities to cover the cost of any video classes you purchase.  We reserve the right to obtain validation of your credit card details before providing you with any video classes.  We are entitled to refuse any order placed by you for any reason.  When your video class purchase is completed, we will confirm acceptance to you by online electronic means to your provided email address.  For any issues that you experience with a video class purchase, you may contact our customer service team at support@creativebug.com.</p>

    <p>If you are not satisfied with your video class purchase, you may request a refund within thirty (30) days after purchase.  Refunds will be issued for the full amount paid for a video class(es), in the original form of payment used to purchase a video class(es).</p>

    <h3>Payment Methods</h3>

    <p>You must have Internet access and a valid Payment Method to subscribe to our Services or purchase a gift subscription. All prices, features, specifications, Offerings, and Content are subject to change or discontinuance at any time without prior notice. Special Service offerings and promotions displayed on the Site are considered no longer valid once they are removed from the Site.</p>

    <p>All prices are listed in U.S. dollars and are valid until altered by us. We currently accept VISA, MasterCard, and American Express credit cards, PayPal (in some instances), and may accept in the future other payment methods (collectively, “Payment Methods”). We reserve the right to change the Payment Methods we accept at any time without notice.</p>

    <p>If we are unable to process a payment using your selected Payment Method, we may, but are under no obligation to, call or email you to ask whether you wish to use an alternate Payment Method. We may terminate your Subscription, withhold upgrades to the Services, and take such other action as appropriate if we are unable to process your Payment Method and you do not provide an alternate Payment Method.
